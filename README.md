##What's this?

This is an experiment on detecting spam SMS with Naive Bayes classifier. You can read about it: [kehers.github.com/2014/09/07/building-an-sms-spam-filter.html](http://kehers.github.com/2014/09/07/building-an-sms-spam-filter.html)

##Shouldn't this be an auto-filter on mobile?

That's where this is going. This page is just a test ground. ~~To be notified once available on mobile, subscribe here: [tinyletter.com/kehers](https://tinyletter.com/kehers)~~ Due to the change in the Android API from 4.4, blocking SMS from reaching the message inbox won't be possible (without developing a full messaging app). For versions, < 4.4, you can download the [WIP] source here: [https://github.com/kehers/snag-android]

##"Snag" though...

Yeah. I am that bad at naming things.
